* Just run the complete code once. Do not run each Cell separatly.
* Let the driver window run in maximised mode. Do not run it in windowed mode(it will maximise by itself)
* Just run the code, sit back and relax
* Do not make any changes in the code except the SAMPLE_USERNAME and SAMPLE_PASSWORD. You can easily change them by refering the code below.
* This code is written and tested with 4G network(AIRTEL). If you are using a 3G connection, you might want to change the time gap between several cells(at the end of some cells there is a line of code whose parameters you might want to alter.
* Recommended network is Airtel 4G or Jio 4G.
* Sometimes you will fell like website is frozen. No! Its not. The cod is still running doing its work. You will notice this specially when the list of followers is being scrolled down. it will take sometime to read through all the follower's usernames.

## Project Introduction
  Imagine how much time you would spend if you had to copy and paste each piece of information you need from a website. Not only would this take hours but it would drain all your energy. Luckily, Instabot automates most of the associated processes.
  This automation process can be done on any website where the user has to do a repeated work of extracing information
  
 ## Tools and Technologies
 
  * Selenium for automation
  * BeautifulSoup for extracting information
  * Implemented in python language
